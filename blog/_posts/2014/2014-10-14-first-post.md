We've been using Github for a few months now. Before that we mostly used Trac/Subversion repositories which we liked but we also had to host ourselves. It is better now, with the Github team doing the hosting for us, and we have learned Git which is a more powerful tool.

Now we're coming to know Jekyll which is nice. So much to blog about, so little time.
