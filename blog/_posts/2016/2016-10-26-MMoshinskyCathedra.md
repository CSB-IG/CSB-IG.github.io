### Congratulations to Dr. Enrique Hernández Lemus, for being awarded the Marcos Moshinsky Catedra on the field of physics!

The Marcos Moshinsky Cathedra is a yearly award given to mexican scientists in physics, mathematics, and biochemistry, for developing a research project in their fields of interest. The winners are rigorously selected by renowned mexican scientists.

The cathedras of research are a permanent homage to the scientific labor of Marcos Moshinsky and a lifetime honour for the awardees. It is expected that, over the years, the awardees form a big family with a common goal: promoting scientific research in Mexico.
