Enrique Hernandez-Lemus, Ph.D. is a Principal Investigator at the Mexican National Institutes of Health and Head of the Computational Systems Biology and Integrative Genomics Lab at the National Institute of Genomic Medicine (Mexico).He is also the Coordinator of the Computational Intelligence Program for the Center of Complexity Sciences, at the National University of Mexico UNAM. From April 2015 through September 2019 he was the Deputy Director of Research for Computational and Population Genomics at the National Institute of Genomic Medicine.

Professor Hernandez-Lemus holds a Ph.D. in Chemical Physics (Non-equilibrium  Statistical Physics - Dynamic Phase Transitions). He started his research career working in Probability Theory and Mathematical Physics, to later turning his attention to problems in Biological Complexity and Systems Biology; has authored more than 170 scientific publications and supervised the work of 30 students at the graduate and undergraduate level.

Dr. Hernandez-Lemus has been a visiting scientist at the Broad Institute of Harvard University and MIT, the Computational Biology Center at the TJ Watson IBM Research Laboratories; the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, the Department of Physics and Mathematics at Rutgers University, the Institute of Complex Systems at the University of Barcelona and the Principe Felipe Research Center in Valencia, among others. 

He has been awarded the 2016 Marcos Moshinsky fellowship in Physical Sciences. He is a member of the Mexican National Researchers’ System (Level III, the highest) and of the Mexican Health Ministry Research Network (level F, the highest). Professor Hernández-Lemus serves as a member for Latin America in the international Human Cell Atlas Consortium, is a member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences, of the Mexican Mathematical Society and the Mexican Physical Society.

Dr. Hernández- Lemus is also a strong advocate for OpenScience/OpenAccess. He is Associate Editor of Computational and Systems Oncology, as well as Academic Editor at PLoS ONE, Scientific Reports, Computational Biology and Chemistry, Frontiers in Physiology, Frontiers in Oncology and Frontiers in Physics. Dr. Hernández-Lemus has devoted special efforts to spread the role of theoretical physics (specially statistical mechanics and complex systems) in the biomedical research community within his country.
